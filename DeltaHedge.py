#Here is a possible quant trading strategy in Python that implements delta hedges:
#In this example, we use the pandas library to load the historical data for a stock and its underlying asset. 
#We then use the scipy library to compute the daily returns for the stock and the asset, as well as the correlation between them.
#We also use the scipy library to compute the price of a call option on the stock, and its delta.
#Finally, we use the delta to construct a delta-hedged portfolio, by taking a long position in the stock and a short position in the underlying asset in the correct ratio. 
#This portfolio is designed to be "delta-neutral", meaning that its value should not be affected by small changes in the price of the stock.
