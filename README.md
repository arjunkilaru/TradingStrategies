# Arjun Kilaru Trading Strategies & Paper Trades
Here is a list of a few trading strategies I have coded that can be readily back-tested or implemented when connected to the relevant data source! In general, I am very interested with the different discretionary and systematic techniques that traders use to either predict, hedge, or profit from the market. Thank you so much for considering me!
I included my methodology for the paper trades in the pages with the screenshots, I beleive you can access them by clicking the three dots in the upper corner.
